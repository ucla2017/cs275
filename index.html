<p>In this work, we present a reinforcement learning method to allow a artificial bird to survive in a randomly generated environment without collision with any obstacles by deciding when to flap the wings. The setting is based on a very popular mobile game called \textit{FlappyBird}. We implemented it in 3D with WebGL, making it easy for public access and experiments with browsers. The bird is given two different perception models: (1) instant fovy, (2) fovy with short-term memory. In both models, the perception state is represented by a $16\times 1$ vector, consisting of coordinates of the two pillars in front of the bird. A reinforcement learning algorithm Q-learning is used to learn a decision policy, powered by which the bird will be able to survive by repeatedly deciding which action to perform given its current perception state. The experiments show our Q-learning algorithm allows the bird to survive for more than 200 pillars.</p>
